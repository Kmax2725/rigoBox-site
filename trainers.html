<h4>Welcome to Rangel's Boxing – A Place to Build Strength, Discipline, and Community</h4>
<p>
Hello, my name is Rigo Rangel. For over 30 years, Las Vegas has been my home, and this gym is my house. My journey here wasn't a straight line, but every step taught me what it takes to survive and thrive.
I was a professional boxer/ fighting not just in my hometown of Mexico City, but also on the big stage here in Las Vegas.<br>After my time in the ring, I served my country in the Army and Special United Drug Enforcement. Those experiences showed me the hard side of the world, but they also reinforced a core belief: discipline, community, and physical strength are the keys to building a better life.<br>
That's exactly why I opened Rangel's Boxing. <br>
We Do What We Do
In a world of phones and internet, it's easy to become disconnected—from each other and from our own health. I believe in getting back to the basics. Sports and physical activity aren't just about building strong bodies; they're about building strong character, focus, and resilience. <br>
My mission is to help our community by creating better citizens and human beings, one boxer at a time. <br>
My Promise to You
I am a certified USA Boxing Coach, and I also bring knowledge as a Medical Veterinarian, which gives me a unique understanding of health, nutrition, and how to support the body. <br>
I'm not perfect, but I will always work hard and put in every effort to help my boxers succeed—not just as athletes, but as people. We focus on the whole person, inside and out. <br>
As I always say:
"The world isn't all rainbows and sunshine. It's a hard place where you have to show the best of yourself to survive and go ahead."
My goal is to see the people in my community happy, healthy, and successful.
Come by the gym. Let's work hard together.
Your friend and coach,
Rigo Rangel</p>
